h2. A pure AS3 FlexUnit example

FlexUnit 4 can be used to test both Flex and Actionscript only projects.  This is a very small application to demonstrate the functionality for as3 only projects.

To Use Application:

* Clone or download project
* Setup Project In Flash Builder
* Run FUAS3Test.as to see that a couple circles get drawn
* Debug TestRunner.as to see that information about the tests is output in the debug panel

Now go implement it on your own in your project!
